# (Unofficial) DayOne App

This is quite easily the dumbest windows application I have ever written,  but here is the deal.  I love DayOne, and since I lost my work computer I have really missed having a desktop application that reminds me that I need to journal.  The ability to keep it on the taskbar is something that I LITERALLY need to remind me to journal.

So here it is... a .NET 8.0 Desktop application that simply wraps the dayone.me web app.
